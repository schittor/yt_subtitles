0:0:58.00,0:1:14.00
Narrator: As a narrator, I will narrate  the background of the story,outline the framework in the form of  harikatha and the Artists will then enact the episode in the style of a play.

Narrator: I would now like to take you to the story Kathanaka of   ThyagaSheela Shri Ramachandra.

0:1:20.00,0:1:28.00
Narrator: Finally after 14 years of exile Shri Ramachandra returns to Ayodhya, to be coronated as king  with grandeur. 

0:1:28.00,0:1:39.00
Narrator: Vaidehi, the picture of  patience and restraint, finally became the queen of Ayodhya, 14 years  after she took Lord Rama's hand as her husband. 

0:1:39.00,0:1:53.00
Narrator: Seethe, who had suffered 14 years of solitary confinement without having committed any crime except for making the mistake of choosing Lord Rama in a Swayamvara, is now at peace. . 

0:1:53.00,0:2:10.00
Narrator: After all the festivities and celebrations, Seethe became pregnant and now at full term,  Seethe expresses her desire to go once to Valmiki sage's ashram and to receive blessings from the revered sages and their wives. 

0:2:10.00,0:2:20.00
Narrator: Overloaded with official duties as the king Rama had given her the assurance that one of these days he will take her out.

0:2:20.00,0:2:31.00
Narrator: Thus their family life and their new life as king and queen of Ayodhya was proceeding smoothly without any incidents

0:2:31.00,0:2:48.00
Narrator: But, but, but   this short lived idyllic life of Seethe was about to be torn into pieces  Shri Rama was sitting in his courtroom deep in thought . 

0:2:50.00,0:3:5.00
Rama: I hear fates wicked cackle all around me now!   I am, Shri Ramachandra, the ultimate Sovereign, one who is attributed to have the 16 virtues as exalted by Sage Narada.

0:3:5.00,0:3:24.00
Rama: One who is conscious of the desires of his subjects, one who protects them as his family, and one who treats his family and his subjects with equal affection, not exhibiting an iota of difference in his treatment of them. 

0:3:24.00,0:3:37.00
Rama: Why am I being accused of a crime? Why is this blemish stuck on my spotless personality?  Why is my very character, my behavior being questioned? ... 

0:3:37.00,0:3:55.00
Rama: I am the ideal of all good things in this world. Why am I being accused? Why is my character being questioned? 

0:3:55.00,0:4:2.00
Rama: I learnt from my courtiers that people were talking very lightly and scornfully about me: "Our king has married  a woman who was abandoned at birth, 

0:4:2.00,0:4:18.00
Rama: has now reunited with her after she has adorned the lap of the demon King Ravana  and one who even the holy fire detested to embrace,  

0:4:18.00,0:4:35.00
Rama: What kind of idealism can such a king who is infatuated with his wife, provide for us and our future generations.  Whatever Rama did, if my wife were to do it, I would not have admitted her into my home."  and so on  

0:4:35.00,0:4:45.00
Rama: What happened? Oh God? Why?	

0:4:45.00,0:4:52.00
Rama: Society tolerates common folks, even if they make huge mistakes without the grasp of the seriousness of their acts. 

0:4:52.00,0:5:8.00
Rama: The babblings of these uneducated people who do not understand the background or the context of their speech is then fully exploited by the evil minded for their evil schemes.  

0:5:8.00,0:5:22.00
Rama: Rama, you are alone, Rama the gracious, people like you, the exalted  leaders, and those who set the ideal for the world are always alone at the top.

0:5:22.00,0:5:33.00
Rama: Even if you make the slightest mistake, it will return like a ghost to haunt you and will swallow you. Rama - it will destroy you. 

0:5:33.00,0:5:44.00
Rama: The only way is to split open the stomach of the python that has swallowed you with your blemish and throw out the sticky blemish that is stuck to you! 

0:5:46.00,0:5:55.00
Oh! Shri Ramachandra, the incarnation of Shriman Narayana, your avatar on this earth is coming to an end.

0:5:55.00,0:6:9.00
The epitome of justice, Shri Rama, your time is coming to an end on this earth, unfetter yourself from the bondage of this earth, return to your origin.

0:6:9.00,0:6:23.00
Oh! Rama,  the great selfless. reject, abandon the love for this earth, detach yourself from the love... to the daughter of this earth  Rama unfetter  

0:6:25.00,0:6:44.00
Lakshmana: Oh! Brother, did you ask for me? It is painful to see you, the Lord of Ayodhya, sitting alone, worried in the middle of the night. 

0:6:44.00,0:6:49.00
Lakshmana: Oh! Brother, what is the reason for your emotional distress?

0:6:51.00,0:7:6.00
Rama: Lakshmana.... What can I say about my worries? I am caught in a vortex and drowning in its depth of despair!. 

0:7:6.00,0:7:19.00
Rama: Light may escape from a black hole, but from the misery I have gotten into, there is no chance of even the slightest ray of hope escaping out ...

0:7:21.00,0:7:29.00
Lakshmana: Oh! Brother, you are the one, who has control over the five senses,  , you are the one who has control over the temptations of the mind? Why are you caught in this dilemma?

0:7:31.00,0:7:40.00
Rama: It has been reported that a washerman has been chatting all over town, "The woman who spent time in the midst of demons is now our queen"... 

0:7:40.00,0:8:0.00
Rama: If the king has any kind of infatuation with his family, discrimination between the family and his subjects will surface without him being aware of it. It is exceedingly difficult to be unblemished, 

0:8:0.00,0:8:17.00
Rama: I am an emperor first, then a husband.  As a king, I owe my undivided attention to my subjects first.They are my core and represent the pulse of the nation... 

0:8:17.00,0:8:28.00
Rama: The king should set the ideals for his people and not be a showman. So, I have now come to a firm resolution ... 

0:8:28.00,0:8:51.00
Rama: There is only one way out - Seethe's renunciation!! I must abandon Seethe!   She of course is blameless and pregnant ... There is no other way out!  There is no other way. 

0:8:51.00,0:9:1.00
Rama: But as her husband I do not have the strength of mind to tell her and incidentally as a king, I need not directly address my subjects of which she is one. 

0:9:1.00,0:9:16.00
Rama: Oh! Lakshmana my brother, as my soul representative as my most faithful ally can I expect help from you, Lakshmana to carry this out?   Can I?

0:9:18.00,0:9:29.00
Lakshmana: Brother, can you please listen to my request once. A dogs barking does not ruin the heavens, let us discuss it once brother, let us think this through.

0:9:31.00,0:9:47.00
Rama: Oh Lakshmana, I order this as king of Ayodhya - tomorrow at the break of the dawn, escort my wife Seethe and leave her at the edge of Valmiki sages ashram on the other side of the forest. 

0:9:47.00,0:9:58.00
Rama: That is, get her out of Ayodhya's borders. Leave her on the south bank of the Ganga. She should not be able to return.   

0:9:58.00,0:10:9.00
Rama: This is a Kings order, this is my strict command ... There is no further discussion about it. .

0:10:11.00,0:10:27.00
Narrator: Those who thrive on exploiting women, those who seek purity in a woman's character, drive their minds without any restraint, and they alter the details according to their prejudices. 

0:10:27.00,0:10:35.00
Narrator: When Ravana kidnapped Seethe, he lifted her by her feet and put her on his Pushpaka Vimana(plane). 

0:10:35.00,0:10:45.00
Narrator: When Ravana saw Seethes resemblance in Mandodari, he picked Seethe and seated her on his right lap... Which lap? The Right one.

0:10:45.00,0:10:57.00
Narrator: Traditionally the left lap is reserved for the wife, the right lap for children... Yet those who complain conveniently forget this.

0:10:57.00,0:11:8.00
Narrator: The Vedic saying Dont seek the origin of a woman or a sage is conveniently exploited in situations like this. 

0:11:8.00,0:11:14.00
Narrator: They interpret the saying to imply a womans origin is suspect, and exploit that. 

0:11:14.00,0:11:28.00
Narrator: Why should this not be applicable to a man? Why should the events of life that were beyond their control should have consequences for their entire life?

0:11:28.00,0:11:32.00
Narrator: The main point here is Rama's attitude which defies all meaning. 

0:11:32.00,0:11:46.00
Narrator: Even in the original Ramayana, once Rama hears about accusations on Seethe he decides to take action overnight and does not even care to see Seethe even once before he abandons her. 

0:11:46.00,0:11:50.00
Narrator: The overpowering kindness of the merciful Rama is limitless and unbound!! 

0:11:50.00,0:11:59.00
Narrator: Comparatively in modern times, we are more kindhearted, open minded, we give much thought before passing judgement and deliberations on anyone let alone ones wife!!

0:11:59.00,0:12:16.00
Narrator: The dark night has come to an end and the sun arose in the sky.  Lakshmana leaves for Valmikis ashram in a chariot with his sister-in-law Seetha. 

0:12:18.00,0:12:31.00
Seethe: Oh, Lakshmana, this forest is so beautiful! The wind is filled with a sweet fragrance as it blows when the chariot moves.

0:12:31.00,0:12:43.00
Seethe: What a sad time it was when we entered a similar forest 15 years ago. We were exiled for 14 years then.

0:12:43.00,0:12:53.00
Seethe: There was unbearable sadness, dissatisfaction, jealousy, and hatred in the family. Our future was dark. 

0:12:53.00,0:13:4.00
Seethe: The memory of wearing an ascetic dress, combing hair in the wax of bitter oil, and departing from Ayodhya on a rocky path is still fresh in my mind. 

0:13:4.00,0:13:18.00
Seethe: I never dreamt that happy days would come. Now I am fully pregnant. What else do I need?  I am very happy. 

0:13:18.00,0:13:26.00
Seethe: How nice it would have been if my god, life-partner, and your brother, Lord Rama, were to be with us now.

0:13:26.00,0:13:37.00
Seethe: After returning to Ayodhya, he has been immersed in ruling the kingdom, and has no time for a stroll in the forest.

0:13:37.00,0:13:50.00
Seethe: What is it, what is it Lakshmana? A weird bird seems to be screaming, my left eyelid is quivering, my shoulders are shaking... Why Lakshmana? 

0:13:50.00,0:13:55.00
Seethe: I am haunted by signs of a bad omen. Lakshmana, please stop the chariot.

0:13:57.00,0:14:8.00
Lakshmana: Sister-in-law, here is the River Ganga.  I will stop the chariot. Let us get down, rest for a while, and slowly cross the river.

0:14:8.00,0:14:16.00
Lakshmana: Might be the strain of the journey that triggered the signs of the bad omen, dont worry it will go away once you rest.

0:14:16.00,0:14:30.00
Lakshmana: There's nothing to panic, Sister-in-law don't be afraid everything is okay. Valmiki's abode is not far from that shore of the Ganga. Let's walk slowly, Sister in Law, slow down! 

0:14:32.00,0:14:41.00
Seethe: Oh, finally we crossed the Ganga. I thought the ashram was near the Ganga. 

0:14:41.00,0:14:54.00
Seethe: Lakshmana I cannot walk too far. Hmm, Lakshmana, the forest is getting denser. What is this Lakshmana?

0:14:54.00,0:15:2.00
Seethe: It's getting dark, I'm tired and scared. let's go back ...? Why dont we see the ashram yet, Laxshman?

0:15:4.00,0:15:19.00
Lakshmana: Oh! God, Oh! Mother, stop, stop... I don't know how to say it. I am tired of following my brothers orders. 

0:15:19.00,0:15:32.00
Lakshmana: The hands that have served you in the past with so much love and care have driven this chariot today. Oh, shouldn't these hands of mine fall off? 

0:15:32.00,0:15:49.00
Lakshmana: I am exhausted. The time I had prayed would never come has arrived, that ominous time has come. no escaping from it now.  

0:15:49.00,0:16:10.00
Lakshmana: Now I need to tell you a bitter truth, I cannot utter these words. Let my tongue melt away, let this earth swallow me.

0:16:10.00,0:16:17.00
Lakshmana: Oh, mother, what can I do?  This is a royal decree - it must be followed and obeyed ....

0:16:17.00,0:16:39.00
Lakshmana: Listen, sister-in-law, listen to this horrible fact - Rama is no longer your husband. I can't say this as your brother-in-law.

0:16:39.00,0:17:2.00
Lakshmana: Gentleman, people, forest dwellers, listen, listen, listen. King of Ayodhya, Shri Ramachandra hereby renunciates his wife, queen Seetha Devi of Ayodhya....

0:17:4.00,0:17:16.00
Seethe: What did you say Lakshmana? Renunciation, renunciation ... My husband Shri Ram has abandoned me?? .... 

0:17:16.00,0:17:29.00
Seethe: Why Lakshmana? What kind of crime have I committed? I have not stepped out of the harem; I have fulfilled all my duties as a wife. I have the result of our union in my womb. 

0:17:29.00,0:17:41.00
Seethe: I don't understand. Is it not enough for me to have suffered these 14 years? Is it not enough to keep Lord Ram's name and fame untainted? 

0:17:41.00,0:17:47.00
Seethe: Is it not enough to declare to the world that I am immaculate when tested by fire? 

0:17:47.00,0:17:51.00
Seethe: Why does my lover want to abandon me? Tell me Lakshmana, tell! Me? 

0:17:53.00,0:18:10.00
Lakshmana: Shri Rama has ordered me to leave you in this dense forest, so that you will not be able to return to Ayodhya. I'm sorry, I'm just the messenger, I do not endorse this, but my hands are tied. 

0:18:10.00,0:18:30.00
Lakshmana: The people of Ayodhya doubted your character. As the world knows, the viceless Rama is immaculate, ruthless, impersonal, not arrogant, not pompous, .... 

0:18:30.00,0:18:44.00
Lakshmana: If all those virtues must stay true and if Rama is to be an ideal man for the world, you cannot be his queen. That is not possible. 

0:18:44.00,0:19:1.00
Lakshmana: If you want to serve Rama's honor, ego, charisma and prestige, you must make this sacrifice, he must renounce you. 

0:19:1.00,0:19:14.00
Lakshmana: The religion requires a devoted wife like you to partake in this sacrifice, society expects it from you, and society demands that sacrifice from every wife... 

0:19:14.00,0:19:24.00
Lakshmana: This male-dominated society has got you  in a corner, my dear sister-in-law, they got you and sacrificed you on the altar to save Ramas ego, Ramas prestige...

0:19:24.00,0:19:41.00
Lakshmana: Oh my, sister-in-law has passed out. What can I do? Nothing. I have obeyed my brother's command and royal orders, so I will return now. 

0:19:41.00,0:19:48.00
Lakshmana: May this mother earth protect you. Forgive me, mother. Your brother-in-law is not even worth the dust on your feet...

0:19:50.00,0:20:4.00
Narrator: Just as a banana tree succumbs and topples over to earth when there is a typhoon, Seethe fell on mother earth as the harsh commands from Lakshmana fell on her ears.

0:20:4.00,0:20:19.00
Narrator: So swooned in sorrow, Lakshmana sprinkled water on Seethe to refresh her. He fanned her and wept in despair thinking did I really get any benefit by serving Rama?

0:20:19.00,0:20:37.00
Narrator: One who was worshipped as the ideal wife, Janakas daughter, the purest of pure, Seethe, falls on the ground with uncontrollable sorrow and unbearable despair.  No, no she falls onto the mother earth, her mother s lap. 

0:20:37.00,0:20:49.00
Narrator: People in command, and those in power get their dirty work done by goons. 

0:20:49.00,0:20:58.00
Narrator: Lakshmana weeps in despair at the situation and wonders about this deed and returns to Ayodhya 

0:21:0.00,0:21:7.00
You are my temple, you are my object of worship, you are my God.

0:21:7.00,0:21:14.00
Oh! My husband just in 14 weeks, 14 weeks you sent me back to the forest

0:21:14.00,0:21:20.00
Oh! The saviour of orphans true to your name did you orphan me?

0:21:20.00,0:21:25.00
Oh! Embodiment of truth, I am perplexed, is It is real or a dream I know not, 

0:21:25.00,0:21:33.00
You made me, the orphaned daughter of Sunayana, the sacrificial goat of your ultimate sacrifice 

0:21:35.00,0:21:45.00
Seethe: What is this, darkness everywhere? What happened? Where am I? Am I in my palace? 

0:21:45.00,0:21:58.00
Seethe: My revered husband, Lord Rama, should be here.... Where is my idol, my god, the resident of all temples, where is he?

0:21:58.00,0:22:12.00
Seethe: I remember now. Lakshmana left me here in the middle of the forest. Why? Why did he leave me here? 

0:22:12.00,0:22:20.00
Seethe: My husband, who is devoid of all vices and is the epitome of virtues... 

0:22:20.00,0:22:41.00
Seethe: Hmm, I am sorry, husband? Who is my husband? I have been abandoned. I do not have a husband.   The king of Ayodhya, the emperor, Shri Ramachandra abandoned his queen!! The just Rama has abandoned the unworthy queen of Ayodhya, the sinner who tarnished his reputation!!

0:22:41.00,0:23:0.00
Seethe: Ha Ha Ha Now Everyone In Ayodhya can live in harmony. The corrupted criminal who roiled amidst the demons is no longer their queen. The slayer of evil, the protector of holy, Shri Rama protected the purity of the throne.

0:23:0.00,0:23:7.00
Seethe: Are men who sacrifice their wife to protect their own reputation really men? I dont understand, I dont. 

0:23:7.00,0:23:15.00
Seethe: It's no use anymore, I'm my own friend, and I'm the one who is responsible for the unborn in my womb. 

0:23:15.00,0:23:28.00
Seethe: The sun is rising, it looks like there is a sages ashrama in the distance, is it Valmiki sages ashram? Let me go and see.

0:23:45.00,0:23:59.00
Seethe: The king? Yes, the husband is in the palace and the wife is in the forest?? Why did you... Janaki became the bride of such a landlord? Why?

0:24:1.00,0:24:14.00
Seethe: Whose bride am I? Purandara Vittalas? or Shri Ramachandra the lord of the universe, or the washerman  on earth ? 

0:24:14.00,0:24:18.00
Seethe: It would have been better to be the bride of a washerman!! It would have been peaceful. 

0:24:18.00,0:24:27.00
Seethe: Ha ha, the ashram is here. I am blessed that the Valmiki sage is coming to meet me. 

0:24:27.00,0:24:29.00
Seethe: Oh Sage, salutations. I am surrendering to you as a helpless destitute, rejected by her husband. Please protect me.

0:24:31.00,0:24:41.00
Valmiki: Come in, daughter, come in, you are tired, come in. 

0:24:41.00,0:24:53.00
Valmiki: I knew that this story would end sooner or later like this. I have authored the story of Rama and hence am not surprised!  Come in and rest. 

0:24:55.00,0:25:7.00
Seethe: Revered Sage, looking at you and accepting your hearty welcome, I am blessed. I am now rejected by my husband, and I'm pregnant. 

0:25:7.00,0:25:25.00
Seethe: Can I find shelter in your ashram? Would the elderly pious women give me support after I have the bad reputation of having disgraced a revered man like Lord Rama ? 

0:25:25.00,0:25:38.00
Seethe: Would I be a burden on this ashram? I do not need this queens gold and diamond     ornaments. I am offering all of this to you . I don't know what else to do ... 

0:25:40.00,0:25:50.00
Valmiki: Do not worry my dear daughter.  The town, the forest, this ashram and the forest beyond are all part of the kingdom and are under his protection.

0:25:50.00,0:26:1.00
Valmiki: The palace as well as the ashram belongs to Rama. From now on, accept this as your home.

0:26:3.00,0:26:10.00
Narrator: Salutations! My name Is Swetha Bhendigeri. I am your next narrator. The first chapter of Seethe's renunciation has thus ended. 

0:26:10.00,0:26:19.00
Narrator: Seethe took refuge in Sage Valmikis ashram and within a few days gave birth to the most adorable twin babies. 

0:26:19.00,0:26:35.00
Narrator: Sage Valmiki named the babies Kusha and Lava. The babies' laughter, their first crawl and their first words filled the ashram with a renewed spirit and rejuvenation.  

0:26:35.00,0:26:41.00
Narrator: One day, while the children were playing, Seethe was seated, lost in her thoughts.

0:26:43.00,0:26:52.00
Seethe: (Speaking to self) Rejected by my parents from birth, I lived a happy life in the company of my guardians for the first 16 years. 

0:26:52.00,0:27:4.00
Seethe: My solitude, which started when I married  Dasaratha's son Shri Ramachandra, the epitome of valor, conqueror of all desires, and the merciful, has not been over to date. 

0:27:4.00,0:27:15.00
Seethe: Why is this the solitude at present? For what crime? Yes I accept that I live amidst demons and bad women .. 

0:27:15.00,0:27:34.00
Seethe: Ha, Ha what did the washerman say about my luxurious life? Hearing my story, he was disgusted, despised, and, as if he had all the evidence, he blabbered as if it is the duty of an honest citizen. 

0:27:34.00,0:27:44.00
Seethe: When the Washerman barked, the lord of our heavens, Shri Ramachandra, 

0:27:44.00,0:28:1.00
Seethe: But..., but... now, in this solitary life, fortunately for peace paid attention and shattered my heavenly dreams with his decision, But there are these sweet, adorable kids. Heavenly life has been restored by them.  

0:28:1.00,0:28:11.00
Seethe: They are now growing up. To expand their intellect they need to be educated and trained as well in warfare . 

0:28:11.00,0:28:23.00
Seethe: But this single parentage is not good for the all-round growth of children. Thus, Valmiki sage has taken up their father's role and taken charge of worldly studies for these two children. 

0:28:23.00,0:28:39.00
Seethe: Now comes the question - Who will teach them warfare and the art of weaponry in  a Sages ashram? I assured the sage that I, daughter of Queen Sunayana will! 

0:28:39.00,0:28:56.00
Seethe: I am not only a master of all weapons of war but have experience fighting on the battlefield, lending shoulder to shoulder with men.

0:28:56.00,0:29:4.00
Seethe: Anyway, children are getting appropriate well rounded education. But above all, the question that now haunts me is their future. 

0:29:4.00,0:29:17.00
Seethe: Their stay here is  temporary, sooner or later they must move away from this ashram. They will figure out the mystery of their birth and their destiny. . 

0:29:17.00,0:29:26.00
Seethe: Oh, looks like there seems to be a spat brewing between them and they are running to me to help mediate . Ha ha ha ....

0:29:28.00,0:29:33.00
Lava: Amma, Amma, Guruji is telling us the story of some God.

0:29:35.00,0:29:44.00
Kusha: Lava one minute, I'll tell you... Amma, there is a king of Ayodhya, Shri Ramachandra. Guruji was telling his history...

0:29:46.00,0:29:49.00
Seethe: (speaking to self) Hmmm, I need to be careful from now on. That's very good, what did he say?

0:29:51.00,0:29:56.00
Lava: It was, Lord Rama had married a queen, and broken a mace...

0:29:58.00,0:30:3.00
Kusha: No Lava, he broke the bow and got married to Seethe, daughter of   king Janaka... 

0:30:5.00,0:30:6.00
Lava: Mother, do you know about that story?

0:30:8.00,0:30:11.00
Seethe: Do I know? Yes, Yes, I know.

0:30:11.00,0:30:19.00
Seethe: (to herself) I was at that unfortunate juncture there ... Poor children... What do they know about my sad story?

0:30:19.00,0:30:38.00
Seethe: Come on, sit. Now that you are a little older, you also have a better understanding and grasp of knowledge. You both have always wanted to know who your father is...

0:30:38.00,0:30:59.00
Seethe: Let us talk about it a little. Cuckoo is the most beautiful bird. Their sound 'kuhoo kuhoo is always heard in our ashram. It is a pleasure to see it leaping from branch to branch. You have fed it many times. Right? 

0:31:1.00,0:31:4.00
Lava: Yes, we love the cuckoo bird

0:31:6.00,0:31:12.00
Seethe: The crow is another bird. If we see a black crow, we drive it away. 

0:31:12.00,0:31:28.00
Seethe: It is a disgusting bird - always eats dead animals, also eats leftovers and rotten things that we do not want. Also, their sound is a bit cacophonic. Right?

0:31:30.00,0:31:34.00
Kusha: Yes, I do not like it, it's a dirty bird.

0:31:36.00,0:32:0.00
Seethe: In our world, there are beautiful bodies, sweet-voiced, exceptionally smooth, showy people like a cuckoo and there are those who are clumsy, shrill, and filthy, like crows. If your father is a cuckoo, I am a crow.

0:32:2.00,0:32:12.00
Kusha: What are you saying, Mom? Our father is a cuckoo, you are a crow? Hmm?? Does not make sense. You're not a crow, you're a cuckoo in every way!!

0:32:14.00,0:32:34.00
Seethe: Where does the cuckoo lay eggs? Who incubates the egg? Who brought food to the cuckoo's chicks? Is it lord Keshava? or is it our loud, black dirt-eating crow? 

0:32:36.00,0:32:42.00
Lava: You are a crow; my father is a cuckoo... I don't understand, where is my father?

0:32:44.00,0:33:7.00
Seethe: Children, what can I say, your father is a great man, courageous and valiant, a king of a big kingdom. I am the daughter of a demon, rejected at birth, and lived among demons who eat filth?

0:33:7.00,0:33:15.00
Seethe: What happened next? I fell prey to the obscene words of a washerman. I am worse than a crow.

0:33:15.00,0:33:30.00
Seethe: Children, you cannot understand this world, where everything that appears pristine and pure externally is not the same at its core.

0:33:30.00,0:33:44.00
Seethe: The exhibition of moral display, philosophical attitude does not translate to sane actions in one's   personal life.... The result is me and you, my children.   What can I say my darlings?  

0:33:46.00,0:33:58.00
Kusha: Mother, you never did tell us who our father is.

0:34:0.00,0:34:5.00
Valmiki: That was not a mace it was a bow, no it was a mace, no bow, no mace ...

0:34:5.00,0:34:26.00
Valmiki: Come on, children, while I was telling you  a story, you both ran away . I will tell you in detail  the history of Lord Rama, the king of Ayodhya and the king of all of us

0:34:26.00,0:34:31.00
Valmiki: Rama breaks the bow and wins Seethe.......

0:34:33.00,0:34:38.00
Kusha: Did he win Seethe, Guruji?  Is this like winning a prize in a game, in a competition? ...

0:34:40.00,0:34:41.00
Lava: Keep quiet Kusha ... Let Guruji tell the story ...

0:34:43.00,0:34:50.00
Seethe: (to herself) I am as blessed as the wife, who hangs on to the tail of a winning bull.... Ha ha ha ...

0:34:52.00,0:35:5.00
Narrator: While the kids were growing up in the ashram of Sage Valmiki receiving a well-rounded education, back in Ayodhya Shri Rama was performing Ashvamedha ritual to expand his kingdom.

0:35:7.00,0:35:16.00
Rama: (To self) As you climb a peak, the panorama expands and you see more of the valley below,  but the people down in the valley get an incredibly detailed view of each of the movements of the people above.

0:35:16.00,0:35:41.00
Rama: Consequently, sharp criticism can be expected for the least of your misstep. So Rama beware, your clean, spotless character can get tarnished. 

0:35:41.00,0:35:52.00
Rama: Valmiki sage completed the Ramayana with  my great coronation and sang victory to Dharma and victory to Rama.

0:35:52.00,0:36:2.00
Rama: But, but... those who came from the south from Ravanas kingdom created a new chapter of 'Uttarakanda Ramayana.

0:36:2.00,0:36:17.00
Rama: My children .... No, No, I have long lost the right to say 'my children, oh, what an unfortunate person I am ....

0:36:17.00,0:36:28.00
Rama: My wife and sons are not with me!  I have abandoned them for the sake of my country, I am the epitome of sacrifice, Rama the great ...

0:36:28.00,0:36:53.00
Rama: Ha ha ha what an irony ... All I can say is Two of the Valmiki ashrams residents, Seethe's children, are the heirs of this throne of Ayodhya, and it is  their birthright.. I have to get them here 

0:36:53.00,0:37:7.00
Rama: Ah, Ah, I have an idea. We can kill two birds with one stone.

0:37:7.00,0:37:15.00
Rama: The saying goes Once a goat has grazed the land, it becomes barren, with no fodder left Similarly where Ramas Ashwa the horse grazes, all of that belongs to me, there is no second thought on that.

0:37:15.00,0:37:36.00
Rama: If anyone dares to tie the horse down, and questions its sovereignty, then it can only be settled by war, whoever wins shall be the rulers of Ayodhya. The sacred white horse that will roam the country in victory, is the solution for my dilemma. 

0:37:36.00,0:37:42.00
Rama: Hmm.... Who's there! Summon Lakshmana to come immediately! 

0:37:44.00,0:37:54.00
Lakshmana: Oh Brother salutations, you told me to come quickly? What is your order? Are you doing well?

0:37:56.00,0:38:1.00
Rama: Please come in, Lakshmana.  Sit down and sit down...

0:38:1.00,0:38:12.00
Rama: How is the Ashvamedha yaga ritual going? Did anyone protest? Did everyone accept the authority of Ayodhya?  Younger brother, tell me.  Did anyone object to our sovereignty?

0:38:14.00,0:38:26.00
Lakshmana: No, brother. Our ceremonial horse has been freely grazing all over the northern part of the Ganga... 

0:38:26.00,0:38:29.00
Lakshmana: Wherever it has grazed, our authority was happily accepted.

0:38:29.00,0:38:40.00
Lakshmana: Expansion of the kingdom has been successful. Shall we withdraw the horse?

0:38:42.00,0:38:52.00
Rama: Ha, Ha, No, No! , let it graze on the south bank of the Ganga also. It is a fertile land that we can claim! All the more benefit to us   

0:38:52.00,0:39:12.00
Rama: Arrange it today, arrange for it, Lakshmana, and you go as its escort. I don't expect much protest there, but it's hard to believe these southerners.

0:39:14.00,0:39:20.00
Lakshmana: Yes, Brother, I will arrange. I'll leave today.

0:39:22.00,0:39:33.00
Narrator: In the original Valmiki Ramayana, the story is intricately woven. But in this Uttarakanda, every incident seems to have been depicted in multiple ways.

0:39:33.00,0:39:40.00
Narrator: Someone on Ravana's side wrote the story, and in protest, the opposite party scripted the story in an alternative track. 

0:39:40.00,0:39:44.00
Narrator: Those who did not take any sides, scripted the story in  a quite different way....

0:39:44.00,0:39:53.00
Narrator: All in all, where is Rama and where are Kusha and Lava? What is their relationship? Such is the story of Uttarakanda.

0:39:53.00,0:40:5.00
Narrator: The first meeting of the father and the children are scripted in multiple ways by various folks, and we present a summation of all those here. 

0:40:5.00,0:40:10.00
Narrator: Let's come back to the arena of our Ashvamedha yajna the sacrament. Lakshmana has accompanied the horse grazing in the south bank of Ganga.  . 

0:40:10.00,0:40:19.00
Narrator: The ritual horse continued to graze and came to the outskirts of Sage Valmikis ashram which had fresh green grass.

0:40:21.00,0:40:29.00
Lava: Hey Kusha, Kusha, there's someone's big horse and it is eating the peas planted by our mother.

0:40:31.00,0:40:39.00
Kusha: Yes !! Mother may be angry when she sees this. Come, come let us chase the horse away.

0:40:46.00,0:41:4.00
Lava: Hey Kusha, look, whatever we do, that horse does not move ? If you look at its decoration, it must be a King's horse, and there's a sign on its forehead ?

0:41:6.00,0:41:24.00
Kusha: Yes, Yes, I will read it. "This horse is the horse of the emperor of Ayodhya, Shri Ramachandra. The land, where it sets foot shall belong to emperor Shri Ramachandra.

0:41:24.00,0:41:34.00
Kusha: Those who tie this horse must have the courage to take on the challenge of facing the emperor and his army."

0:41:34.00,0:41:45.00
Kusha: Ha, I do not care what is written on its forehead. Let us tie this horse to see what happens. It has no right to graze in our garden.

0:41:47.00,0:42:3.00
Narrator: Hearing the news of the ceremonial horse being tied up, Lakshamana tries to talk the kids to release the horse, but to no avail.. A battle ensues. Laxshmana is gravely wounded by the arrows of  Lava and Kusha.

0:42:3.00,0:42:13.00
Narrator: The invincible son of the wind god  (Hanumantha) and Jambavanta are reluctant to fight against the children. The injured Lakshmana returns to Ayodhya quickly.

0:42:15.00,0:42:24.00
Lakshmana: Brother, Shri Ramachandra, it was a disaster, and I tarnished your name. Alas ...

0:42:26.00,0:42:39.00
Rama: What happened? Lakshmana, tell me, you are hurt with wounds all over you, who did this to you?    I will eliminate him!!

0:42:39.00,0:42:49.00
Rama: When someone harms you, it is like harming me, it's like harming the throne of this kingdom!!

0:42:49.00,0:42:56.00
Rama: Brother, it is about the honor of the kingdom of Ayodhya, its dignity must be maintained, tell me brother, who is this evil guy?

0:42:58.00,0:43:22.00
Lakshmana: Brother, it is not one miscreant but two boys!! Those dazzling boys have all the charisma of princes.These kids did this sacrilege without being aware of what they are doing.

0:43:22.00,0:43:41.00
Lakshmana: But our horse is in their hands. You have to go to free it and end this war. Brother, despite the fact I got hurt by them my heart goes out to them. 

0:43:41.00,0:43:47.00
Lakshmana: I feel that a new page is about to be opened in the chapter of Ayodhya!

0:43:49.00,0:43:55.00
Narrator: Aware of the seriousness of the occasion, Rama immediately takes the chariot without delay and rushes to where the horse has been tied

0:43:57.00,0:44:7.00
Rama: What is this disaster? Everyone has fallen unconscious. Who are these evil boys? Is my Ashvamedha ritual becoming a genocide?

0:44:9.00,0:44:14.00
Lava: We are those evil boys, this is our land, our home....

0:44:16.00,0:44:20.00
Kusha: Be it the king of the town, or even if Shri Rama comes, we will not give this up!!

0:44:22.00,0:44:28.00
Narrator: A fierce battle ensues. In which Rama falls unconscious.

0:44:28.00,0:44:39.00
Narrator: If we look at the Ramayana and Mahabharata epics in the framework of our present environment, there is a great deal of disharmony and logical errors.

0:44:39.00,0:44:49.00
Narrator: In Ramayana, the story is not significant, not important, the content and subject is important, the lesson we learn from it is important

0:44:49.00,0:45:0.00
Narrator: In any case, Ayodhya's king has fallen down unconscious. Anjaneya and Jambavanta are alarmed and they try to convince the children. They all head towards the Ashram for support.

0:45:2.00,0:45:7.00
Kusha: Mother, mother, look, who has come?

0:45:9.00,0:45:17.00
Lava: Really, Hanuman and Jambavanta have come. We beat Lord Ram and toppled him!!

0:45:19.00,0:45:24.00
Seethe: Oh, what did you do, children? What a disaster you have created? 

0:45:26.00,0:45:41.00
Valmiki: Do not worry, do not worry, I will retrieve  everyone with the power from my penance. Children show me where your squabble happened.

0:45:43.00,0:45:58.00
Seethe: (Soliloquy) Shall I go? Is the human word genderless? Should the ones who receive courtesy are men only, can women receive this too?

0:45:58.00,0:46:4.00
Seethe: Is it humane to say, "Abandon the pregnant woman in a dense forest and ensure she is unable to return?

0:46:4.00,0:46:18.00
Seethe: Is it the evil, the tainted Seethes responsibility to revive such a man, who is the personification of sacrifice, the merciful Shri Ramachandra, who has fallen in the battlefield and is lying unconscious?

0:46:18.00,0:46:39.00
Seethe: No, no. I have to go. Otherwise, I become infamous as the wife who never went to care for her wounded husband? No, no, my list of ignominy is already long enough . Let me go and see. 

0:46:39.00,0:46:46.00
Seethe: I'll go, I'll see... Is the last stage of this Ashwamedha yaga the beginning of the final journey of my unfortunate and tragic life?

0:46:46.00,0:47:2.00
Seethe: Oh! Shri Ramachandra, the time has come  for me to make my final sacrifice, of handing over  my children  to you . I am the puppet of fate, I am unfortunate and helpless ..... I shall go!  ...

0:47:4.00,0:47:11.00
Narrator: Sage Valmiki, children and Seethe all come to the place where the ceremonial   horse is tied.

0:47:11.00,0:47:23.00
Narrator: The sage wakes up all the unconscious with his hymns. In the distance, Seethe has her back to everyone, her head bowed and staring at a blade of grass in her hand.

0:47:23.00,0:47:30.00
Narrator: Children don't understand what's happening and they stand near their mom holding her saree. 

0:47:30.00,0:47:35.00
Narrator: Sage Valmiki realizes the seriousness of the relationship and the context and provides pretext for the following dialogue.

0:47:37.00,0:47:46.00
Valmiki: Children, you don't understand anything now,  Yes, not just you, but I also do not.

0:47:46.00,0:48:1.00
Valmiki: I had not visualized that this situation would end up like this, even though I had anticipated the hustle and bustle of emotions but not to this extent. 

0:48:1.00,0:48:8.00
Valmiki: I will introduce you to the kind of situation we are in here and leave it in the hands of that fate.

0:48:8.00,0:48:24.00
Valmiki: Kusha, Lava, I am your guru and even more your foster father. Shri Ramachandra, the Lord of Ayodhya, whom I had sung and preached for so long, is standing before you here.

0:48:24.00,0:48:31.00
Valmiki: He is not only your king but also your biological father, he is your father.

0:48:31.00,0:48:37.00
Valmiki: I have finished my duty. I did not anticipate this ending. It is time for me to leave. 

0:48:39.00,0:48:52.00
Rama: (Soliloquy) On the one hand I am extremely happy, and on the other hand I am extremely sad 

0:48:52.00,0:49:9.00
Rama: At once looking at my offspring, their brilliance, their charisma, I feel elated. On the other hand, the disgust and contempt at myself for abandoning my wife is overpowering.

0:49:9.00,0:49:15.00
Rama: I am repulsed at myself, I am caught in this emotional turmoil  

0:49:15.00,0:49:43.00
Rama: Right or wrong, I have followed a chosen path to appease the world and I must continue in its course. As king, my primary duty is to the throne of Ayodhya, its future, and the comfort of others. 

0:49:43.00,0:49:46.00
Rama: Oh! Queen 

0:49:48.00,0:50:1.00
Rama: (Soliloquy) Peace, peace, I have made a mistake, I apologize!   Seethe, I do not know what to say. 

0:50:1.00,0:50:13.00
Rama: Our duty to the crown and the citizens who believed in us are paramount and should be placed above our relationships and feelings. 

0:50:13.00,0:50:23.00
Rama: My hands that held you with our wedding vows are now tied, and I have nothing left in these crushed hands. 

0:50:23.00,0:50:36.00
Rama: The prosperity and future of Ayodhya is in your hands. You are a royal woman, do what you see as rightful. .

0:50:38.00,0:50:47.00
Seethe: Queen? Royal woman? Hmm ..  Are you mocking me??... not in this life, unreal!! It is all inimitable paranoia sins of the past.

0:50:47.00,0:50:54.00
Seethe: The comet has taken off from its orbital path never to return. 

0:50:54.00,0:51:1.00
Seethe: I am Ravana's daughter, who has emerged from mother earth. . The purpose of my birth has been fulfilled. 

0:51:1.00,0:51:10.00
Seethe: Oh!! Emperor, in the ritual of  Ashvamedha yaga, finally you sacrifice the ritual horse. My fate is the same as the horse.

0:51:10.00,0:51:31.00
Seethe: You have achieved the purpose of this yaga. The kingdom has expanded, the heir to the kingdom has been located, and a stigma of this dynasty will be eliminated soon. The fruits of your great sacrifice have been realized 

0:51:31.00,0:51:47.00
Seethe: Kusha, Lava, children, I have loved you more than my life in all these years. The goal of my life is the happiness of both of you, your bright future, and above all your comfort!

0:51:47.00,0:52:0.00
Seethe: What did I say, "I love you more than my life". Yes, now it is time to conclude my life.

0:52:0.00,0:52:19.00
Seethe: This world took everything away from me, you children are all I have. I've lived all these years for you both. I love you both more than my life. Now I must partake in separating me and my life. 

0:52:21.00,0:52:35.00
Rama: Oh! Seetha Devi, I have a request .. Please listen patiently. 

0:52:35.00,0:52:53.00
Rama: In response to Washerman's remarks, I should have proved your innocence and purity to the citizens of Ayodhya with another test of purification by fire. That was a mistake that I made. I slipped in my duty. 

0:52:53.00,0:53:10.00
Rama: But it's not too late yet. Are you ready for another test by fire? And then all my subjects and our family can happily live ever after. 

0:53:12.00,0:53:27.00
Seethe: Ha, Ha, Ha!! A test? test by fire? Audience, here is a question from me. If a helpless lady is captured by demons and in their custody, the test for her purity and chastity is a test by fire.

0:53:27.00,0:53:36.00
Seethe: Is there such a test for fidelity of a strong man who walks around freely in the forest for 14 years?

0:53:36.00,0:53:46.00
Seethe: Are there any language experts here? Why is there no word for the fidelity of a married man in our dictionary? Why not?

0:53:46.00,0:53:53.00
Seethe: In our masculine society, all constraints are for women only. 

0:53:53.00,0:54:6.00
Seethe: Hey, Rama, listen! I cannot help your restless mind, your mind focused on your own self-reflection.

0:54:6.00,0:54:15.00
Seethe: A Personification of sacrifice! Oh Shri Rama, listen. I will forget my own interests and give these children of mine, who were born in my womb.

0:54:15.00,0:54:30.00
Seethe: Their future should not be ruined by my selfishness. This is sacrifice, it is a true sacrifice. Oh, the epitome of sacrifice Shri Rama, this is indefatigable, absolute, pure sacrifice. Yes !

0:54:30.00,0:54:47.00

0:56:51.00,0:57:4.00
Summary: These righteous and self-assumed modern thinkers create literature just to purport their skewed thoughts

0:57:4.00,0:57:14.00
Summary: You just viewed our Kathanaka and might feel we are no different than them.

0:57:14.00,0:57:29.00
Summary: No, no, our intentions are just the opposite. Ramayana and Mahabharatha are the foundation stones of Sanathana Dharma Applicable to our daily life forever. 

0:57:29.00,0:57:37.00
Summary: We are not qualified enough to comment on the great sages like Valmiki and Vyasa. It is also not our objective either.

0:57:37.00,0:57:54.00
Summary: Our views are that the stories, incidents and the people in them are just incidental, providing a framework to explain the main theme. The theme/morality it extoles and advocates are critical. 

0:57:54.00,0:58:8.00

0:58:31.00,0:58:44.00
Summary: From the point of view of a rationality of literature,  it is reasonable, but not to be implemented in life, and certainly not to be imitated.

0:58:44.00,0:58:59.00
Summary: Our point of view is that even Shri Rama the God himself commits mistakes, discriminates against women  Even he is not above the common human weaknesses/follies.

0:58:59.00,0:59:10.00
Summary: Discrimination is very deep rooted in us, it is in our blood even it perpetuates to the very Gods we worship. 

0:59:10.00,0:59:31.00
Summary: Ah! This reminds me of a good example. Handing over Sita to Rama, King Janaka poignantly says Oh! Rama, my daughter Sita is a SahaDharmaChaarini, meaning she follows the path of Dharma.

0:59:31.00,0:59:53.00
Summary: The moment you deviate from the path of Dharma she will move away from you. Oh! Rama be very careful do not deviate from the logical path of just, ensure Sita, the embodiment of Dharma, is always following you.

1:0:46.00,1:0:58.00
Summary: What Ramayana wants and hopes to convey to us is, when one is just and executing actions Dharmic way, that should not have negative effect on the other actions of the person, 

1:0:58.00,1:1:14.00
Summary: Yes, we do know for a king protocol of execution of his duty as a king is higher priority however the division between one Dharmic way and the other should not be of the ratio of 90:10

When a brahmin is born did he come with Janivara, a sacred thread?When a Shiva devotee is born does he come with a Shiva sacred thread?

1:4:46.00,1:4:58.00
We all come to this earth totally nacked. But then fight over the superiority over each other
