0.27 Namaskara,  My name is Geetha Rao. Welcome to the third presentation of Vayuvya 
Samskrithika Kendra (VSK) - ‘Thyagasheela Shri Ramachandra’  
0.41 If you are interested please watch our other Kathanakas Sitayana and Bhishama Durantha in 
VSK Portland YouTube channel. 
0.51 Our presentation  has a distinctive format of a combination of harikatha and play. 
0.58 As a narrator, I will narrate  the background of the story,outline the framework in the form of  
harikatha and the Artists will then enact the episode in the style of a play. 
1.14 I would now like to take you to the story “Kathanaka” of   ThyagaSheela Shri Ramachandra.
1.20 Finally after 14 years of exile Shri Ramachandra returns to Ayodhya, to be coronated as king  
with grandeur. 
1.28 Vaidehi, the picture of  patience and restraint, finally became the queen of Ayodhya, 14 years  
after she took Lord Rama's hand as her husband. 
1.39 Seethe, who had suffered 14 years of solitary confinement without having committed any crime 
except for making the mistake of choosing Lord Rama in a Swayamvara, is now at peace. . 
1.53 After all the festivities and celebrations, Seethe became pregnant and now at full term,  Seethe 
expresses her desire to go once to Valmiki sage's ashram and to receive blessings from the revered 
sages and their wives. 
2.10 Overloaded with official duties as the king Rama had given her the assurance that one of these 
days he will take her out.
2.20 Thus their family life and their new life as king and queen of Ayodhya was proceeding smoothly 
without any incidents
2.31 But, but, but …  this short lived idyllic life of Seethe was about to be torn into pieces … Shri 
Rama was sitting in his courtroom deep in thought ….

2.47 I hear fate’s wicked cackle all around me now!   I am, Shri Ramachandra, the ultimate Sovereign, one 
who is attributed to have the 16 virtues as exalted by Sage Narada.
3.03 One who is conscious of the desires of his subjects, one who protects them as his family, and one who 
treats his family and his subjects with equal affection, not exhibiting an iota of difference in his treatment of 
them. 
3.22 Why am I being accused of a crime? Why is this blemish stuck on my spotless personality?  Why is my 
very character, my behavior being questioned? ... 
3.35  I am the ideal of all good things in this world. Why am I being accused? Why is my character being 
questioned? 
3.53 I learnt from my courtiers that people were talking very lightly and scornfully about me: "Our king has 
married  a woman who was abandoned at birth, 
4.00 has now reunited with her after she has adorned the lap of the demon King Ravana  and one who even 
the holy fire detested to embrace,  
4.16 What kind of idealism can such a king who is infatuated with his wife, provide for us and our future 
generations.  Whatever Rama did, if my wife were to do it, I would not have admitted her into my 
home."  and so on … 
4.33 What happened? Oh God? Why?	
4.43 Society tolerates common folks, even if they make huge mistakes without the grasp of the seriousness 
of their acts. 
4.50 The babblings of these uneducated people who do not understand the background or the context of 
their speech is then fully exploited by the evil minded for their evil schemes.  
5.06 Rama, you are alone, Rama the gracious, people like you, the exalted  leaders, and those who set the 
ideal for the world are always alone at the top.
5.20 Even if you make the slightest mistake, it will return like a ghost to haunt you and will swallow you. 
Rama - it will destroy you. 
5.31 The only way is to split open the stomach of the python that has swallowed you with your blemish and 
throw out the sticky blemish that is stuck to you!

to an end.
5.52  The epitome of justice, Shri Rama, your time is coming to an end on this earth, unfetter yourself 
from the bondage of this earth, return to your origin.
6.06 Oh! Rama,  the great selfless…. reject, abandon the love for this earth, detach yourself from the 
love... to the daughter of this earth … Rama unfetter …

worried in the middle of the night. 
6.31 Oh! Brother, what is the reason for your emotional distress?

Clip T T5-P1-RA:  0.30
6.37 Lakshmana.... What can I say about my worries? I am caught in a vortex and drowning in its 
depth of despair!. 
6.53 Light may escape from a black hole, but from the misery I have gotten into, there is no chance 
of even the slightest ray of hope escaping out ...

Clip T T6-P1-LK: 0.10
7.07 Oh! Brother, you are the one, who has control over the five senses,  , you are the one who has 
control over the temptations of the mind? Why are you caught in this dilemma?

Clip T T7-P1-RA: 1.47
7.17 It has been reported that a washerman has been chatting all over town, "The woman who spent time in 
the midst of demons is now our queen"... 
7.27 If the king has any kind of infatuation with his family, discrimination between the family and his subjects 
will surface without him being aware of it. It is exceedingly difficult to be unblemished, 
7.47 I am an emperor first, then a husband.  As a king, I owe my undivided attention to my subjects first.
They are my core and represent the pulse of the nation... 
8.04 The king should set the ideals for his people and not be a showman. So, I have now come to a firm 
resolution ... 
8.15 There is only one way out - Seethe's renunciation!! I must abandon Seethe!   She of course is 
blameless and pregnant ... There is no other way out!  There is no other way. 
8.38 But as her husband I do not have the strength of mind to tell her and incidentally as a king, I need not 
directly address my subjects of which she is one. 
8.48 Oh! Lakshmana my brother, as my soul representative as my most faithful ally can I expect help from 
you, Lakshmana to carry this out?   Can I?

Clip T T8-P1-LK: 0.13

discuss it once brother, let us think this through.

Clip T T9-P1-RA: 0.40
9.17 Oh Lakshmana, I order this as king of Ayodhya - tomorrow at the break of the dawn, escort my 
wife Seethe and leave her at the edge of Valmiki sage’s ashram on the other side of the forest. 
9.34 That is, get her out of Ayodhya's borders. Leave her on the south bank of the Ganga. She 
should not be able to return.   
9.45 This is a King’s order, this is my strict command ... There is no further discussion about it. .

9.57 Those who thrive on exploiting women, those who seek purity in a woman's character, drive their minds 
without any restraint, and they alter the details according to their prejudices. 
10.14 When Ravana kidnapped Seethe, he lifted her by her feet and put her on his Pushpaka 
Vimana(plane). 
10.22 When Ravana saw Seethe’s resemblance in Mandodari, he picked Seethe and seated her on his right 
lap... Which lap? The Right one.
10.32 Traditionally the left lap is reserved for the wife, the right lap for children... Yet those who complain 
conveniently forget this.
10.44 The Vedic saying “Don’t seek the origin of a woman or a sage” is conveniently exploited in situations 
like this. 
10.55 They interpret the saying to imply a woman’s origin is suspect, and exploit that. 
11.01 Why should this not be applicable to a man? Why should the events of life that were beyond their 
control should have consequences for their entire life?
11.15 The main point here is Rama's attitude which defies all meaning. 
11.19 Even in the original Ramayana, once Rama hears about accusations on Seethe he decides to take 
action overnight and does not even care to see Seethe even once before he abandons her. 
11.33 The overpowering kindness of the merciful Rama is limitless and unbound!! 
11.37 Comparatively in modern times, we are more kindhearted, open minded, we give much thought before 
passing judgement and deliberations on anyone let alone one’s wife!!
11.46 The dark night has come to an end and the sun arose in the sky.  Lakshmana leaves for Valmiki’s 
ashram in a chariot with his sister-in-law Seetha.

12.01 Oh, Lakshmana, this forest is so beautiful! The wind is filled with a sweet fragrance as it blows when 
the chariot moves.
12.15 What a sad time it was when we entered a similar forest 15 years ago. We were exiled for 14 years 
then.
12.27 There was unbearable sadness, dissatisfaction, jealousy, and hatred in the family. Our future was 
dark. 
12.37 The memory of wearing an ascetic dress, combing hair in the wax of bitter oil, and departing from 
Ayodhya on a rocky path is still fresh in my mind. 
12.48 I never dreamt that happy days would come. Now I am fully pregnant. What else do I need?  I am very 
happy. 
13.02 How nice it would have been if my god, life-partner, and your brother, Lord Rama, were to be with us 
now.
13.10 After returning to Ayodhya, he has been immersed in ruling the kingdom, and has no time for a stroll 
in the forest.
13.21 What is it, what is it Lakshmana? A weird bird seems to be screaming, my left eyelid is quivering, my 
shoulders are shaking... Why Lakshmana? 
13.34 I am haunted by signs of a bad omen. Lakshmana, please stop the chariot.

Clip T T12-P1-LK:  0.37
13.40 Sister-in-law, here is the River Ganga.  I will stop the chariot. Let us get down, rest for a while, 
and slowly cross the river.
13.52 Might be the strain of the journey that triggered the signs of the bad omen, don’t worry it will 
go away once you rest.
14.0 There's nothing to panic, Sister-in-law don't be afraid everything is okay. Valmiki's abode is not 
far from that shore of the Ganga. Let's walk slowly, Sister in Law, slow down! 
 
Clip T T13-P1-SE1: 0.32
14.18 Oh, finally we crossed the Ganga. I thought the ashram was near the Ganga. 
14.27 Lakshmana I cannot walk too far. Hmm, Lakshmana, the forest is getting denser. What is this 
Lakshmana?
14.40 It's getting dark, I'm tired and scared. let's go back ...? Why don’t we see the ashram yet, Laxshman?

Clip T T14-P1-LK:   2.0
14.50 Oh! God, Oh! Mother, stop, stop... I don't know how to say it. I am tired of following my brother’s 
orders. 
15.05 The hands that have served you in the past with so much love and care have driven this chariot today. 
Oh, shouldn't these hands of mine fall off? 
15.18 I am exhausted. The time I had prayed would never come has arrived, that ominous time has come. 
no escaping from it now.  
15.35 Now I need to tell you a bitter truth, I cannot utter these words. Let my tongue melt away, let this earth 
swallow me.
15.56 Oh, mother, what can I do?  This is a royal decree - it must be followed and obeyed ....
16.03 Listen, sister-in-law, listen to this horrible fact - Rama is no longer your husband. I can't say this as 
your brother-in-law.
16.25 Gentleman, people, forest dwellers, listen, listen, listen. King of Ayodhya, Shri Ramachandra hereby 
renunciates his wife, queen Seetha Devi of Ayodhya....

Clip T T15-P1-SE1: 0.49 
16.50 What did you say Lakshmana? Renunciation, renunciation ... My husband Shri Ram has 
abandoned me?? .... 
17.02 Why Lakshmana? What kind of crime have I committed? I have not stepped out of the harem; 
I have fulfilled all my duties as a wife. I have the result of our union in my womb. 
17.15 I don't understand. Is it not enough for me to have suffered these 14 years? Is it not enough to 
keep Lord Ram's name and fame untainted? 
17.27 Is it not enough to declare to the world that I am immaculate when tested by fire? 
17.33 Why does my lover want to abandon me? Tell me Lakshmana, tell! Me? 

Clip T T16-P1-LK: 1.58 
17.39 Shri Rama has ordered me to leave you in this dense forest, so that you will not be able to 
return to Ayodhya. I'm sorry, I'm just the messenger, I do not endorse this, but my hands are tied. 
17.56 The people of Ayodhya doubted your character. As the world knows, the viceless Rama is 
immaculate, ruthless, impersonal, not arrogant, not pompous, .... 
18.16 If all those virtues must stay true and if Rama is to be an ideal man for the world, you cannot 
be his queen. That is not possible. 
18.30 If you want to serve Rama's honor, ego, charisma and prestige, you must make this sacrifice, 
he must renounce you. 
18.47 The religion requires a devoted wife like you to partake in this sacrifice, society expects it from 
you, and society demands that sacrifice from every wife... 
19.0 This male-dominated society has got you  in a corner, my dear sister-in-law, they got you and 
sacrificed you on the altar to save Rama’s ego, Rama’s prestige...
19.10 Oh my, sister-in-law has passed out. What can I do? Nothing. I have obeyed my brother's 
command and royal orders, so I will return now. 
19.27 May this mother earth protect you. Forgive me, mother. Your brother-in-law is not even worth 
the dust on your feet...

19.37 Just as a banana tree succumbs and topples over to earth when there is a typhoon, Seethe fell 
on mother earth as the harsh commands from Lakshmana fell on her ears.
19.52 So swooned in sorrow, Lakshmana sprinkled water on Seethe to refresh her. He fanned her and 
wept in despair thinking did I really get any benefit by serving Rama?
20.07 One who was worshipped as the ideal wife, Janaka’s daughter, the purest of pure, Seethe, falls 
on the ground with uncontrollable sorrow and unbearable despair.  No, no she falls onto the mother 
earth, “her mother ’s lap”. 
20.25 People in command, and those in power get their dirty work done by goons.

all temples, where is he?
21.26 I remember now. Lakshmana left me here in the middle of the forest. Why? Why did he leave me 
here? 
21.40 My husband, who is devoid of all vices and is the epitome of virtues... 
21.48 Hmm, I am sorry, husband? Who is my husband? I have been abandoned. I do not have a husband.   
The king of Ayodhya, the emperor, Shri Ramachandra abandoned his queen!! The just Rama has 
abandoned the unworthy queen of Ayodhya, the sinner who tarnished his reputation!!
22.09 Ha Ha Ha Now Everyone In Ayodhya can live in harmony. The corrupted criminal who roiled amidst 
the demons is no longer their queen. The slayer of evil, the protector of holy, Shri Rama protected the purity 
of the throne.
22.28 Are men who sacrifice their wife to protect their own reputation really men? I don’t understand, I don’t. 
22.35 It's no use anymore, I'm my own friend, and I'm the one who is responsible for the unborn in 
my womb.

26.03 (Speaking to self) Rejected by my parents from birth, I lived a happy life in the company of my 
guardians for the first 16 years. 
26.13 My solitude, which started when I married  Dasaratha's son Shri Ramachandra, the epitome of 
valor, conqueror of all desires, and the merciful, has not been over to date. 
26.25 Why is this the solitude at present? For what crime? Yes I accept that I live amidst demons 
and bad women .. 
26.36 Ha, Ha what did the washerman say about my “luxurious life”? Hearing my story, he was 
disgusted, despised, and, as if he had all the evidence, he blabbered as if it is the duty of an honest 
citizen. 
26.55 When the Washerman barked, the lord of our heavens, Shri Ramachandra, 
27.05 But..., but... now, in this solitary life, fortunately for peace paid attention and shattered my 
heavenly dreams with his decision, 
But there are these sweet, adorable kids. Heavenly life has been restored by them.  
27.22 They are now growing up. To expand their intellect they need to be educated and trained as 
well in warfare . 
27.32 But this single parentage is not good for the all-round growth of children. Thus, Valmiki sage 
has taken up their father's role and taken charge of worldly studies for these two children. 
27.44 Now comes the question - Who will teach them warfare and the art of weaponry in  a Sage’s 
ashram? I assured the sage that I, daughter of Queen Sunayana will! 
28.00 I am not only a master of all weapons of war but have experience fighting on the battlefield, 
lending shoulder to shoulder with men.
28.17 Anyway, children are getting appropriate well rounded education. But above all, the question 
that now haunts me is their future. 
28.25 Their stay here is  temporary, sooner or later they must move away from this ashram. They 
will figure out the mystery of their birth and their destiny. .

34.31 (To self) As you climb a peak, the panorama expands and you see more of the valley below .  .  but 
the people down in the valley get an incredibly detailed view of each of the movements of the people above.
34.41 Consequently, sharp criticism can be expected for the least of your misstep. So Rama 
beware, your clean, spotless character can get tarnished. 
35.06 Valmiki sage completed the Ramayana with  my great coronation and sang victory to Dharma 
and victory to Rama.
35.17 But, but... those who came from the south from Ravana’s kingdom created a new chapter of 
‘Uttarakanda Ramayana’.
35.27 My children .... No, No, I have long lost the right to say ‘my children’, oh, what an unfortunate 
person I am ....
35.42 My wife and sons are not with me!  I have abandoned them for the sake of my country, I am 
the epitome of sacrifice, Rama the great ...
35.53 Ha ha ha what an irony ... All I can say is “Two of the Valmiki ashram’s residents, Seethe's 
children, are the heirs of this throne of Ayodhya, and it is  their birthright..” I have to get them here 
36.18 Ah, Ah, I have an idea. We can kill two birds with one stone.
36.32 The saying goes “Once a goat has grazed the land, it becomes barren, with no fodder left” 
Similarly where Rama’s “Ashwa” the horse grazes, all of that belongs to me, there is no second 
thought on that.
36.40 If anyone dares to tie the horse down, and questions its sovereignty, then it can only be 
settled by war, whoever wins shall be the rulers of Ayodhya. The sacred white horse that will roam 
the country in victory, is the solution for my dilemma. 
37.01 Hmm.... Who's there! Summon Lakshmana to come immediately!

authority of Ayodhya?  Younger brother, tell me.  Did anyone object to our sovereignty?

37.38 No, brother. Our ceremonial horse has been freely grazing all over the northern part of the 
Ganga... 
37.51 Wherever it has grazed, our authority was happily accepted.
37.54 Expansion of the kingdom has been successful. Shall we withdraw the horse?

38.06 Ha, Ha, No, No! , let it graze on the south bank of the Ganga also. It is a fertile land that we 
can claim! All the more benefit to us

38.45 In the original Valmiki Ramayana, the story is intricately woven. But in this “Uttarakanda”, every 
incident seems to have been depicted in multiple ways.
38.57 Someone on Ravana's side wrote the story, and in protest, the opposite party scripted the story in 
an alternative track. 
39.04 Those who did not take any sides, scripted the story in  a quite different way....
39.08 All in all, where is Rama and where are Kusha and Lava? What is their relationship? Such is the 
story of Uttarakanda.
39.17 The first meeting of the father and the children are scripted in multiple ways by various folks, and we 
present a summation of all those here. 
39.29 Let's come back to the arena of our “Ashvamedha yajna” the sacrament. Lakshmana has 
accompanied the horse grazing in the south bank of Ganga.  . 
39.34 The ritual horse continued to graze and came to the outskirts of Sage Valmiki’s ashram which had 
fresh green grass.

these children of mine, who were born in my womb.

conclusion. Now the conclusion.

Scene 22 = T85 55.30 
Clip T T85-L1-SR: 4.27
55.30 Many of Shri Shatavadhani Ganesh's speeches; especially his Shrimad Mahabharatha - a 106 
lecture series, have greatly influenced our narration of Thyagasheela ShriRamachandra  .
55.46 In that, he subtly explains how many senior/famous writers and so called revolutionary 
thinkers who, by with the virtue of their societal positions waste time by, 
55.52 blabbering out the many  irrational, illogical aspects of the stories in the epics such as gender 
discrimination, lack of relevance, and lack of substance in some stories and subplots. 
56.11 These righteous and self assumed modern thinkers create literature just to purport their 
skewed thoughts
56.24 You just viewed our Kathanaka and might feel we are no different than them.
56.33 No, no, our intentions are just the opposite. We are not qualified enough to comment on the 
great sages like Valmiki and Vyasa. 
56.53 Our views are that the stories, incidents and the people in them are just incidental, providing a 
framework to explain the main theme. The theme/morality it extoles and advocates are critical . 
57.08 From the title of the page to the end  it appears we have ridiculed lord Shri Rama. However 
the reality is not so. 
57.21 Wise sages like Valmiki/Vyasa have kept in mind hundreds of people with tens of facets of our 
mad mind while shaping their poetry.
57.33 We, one of those hundreds of people, have devised this plot using one of our ten facets.
57.41 From the point of view of a rationality of literature,  it is reasonable, but not to be implemented 
in life, and certainly not to be imitated.
57.52 Our point of view is that even Shri Rama the God himself commits mistakes, discriminates 
against women … Even he is not above the common human weaknesses/follies.
58.07 Discrimination is very deep rooted in us, it is in our blood even it prepetuates to the very Gods 
we worship. 
58.18 Sage Valmiki’s through his epic Ramayana exemplifies the moral strength and courage of  
women, their resilience under trying circumstances and their capacity for self sacrifice.
58.36 Every product has its specific functions and they come with a user manual to guide its users to 
use it.
58.45  Similarly Ramayana and Mahabharatha are the user manual for our very lives.  
58.53 Ramayana, Mahabharata, etc., are a platform to train us to find a multifaceted solution to the 
problems that we face every day. 
59.00 They provide a metaphorical framework using which we can design our day to day life to lead 
a chaste life. 
59.15 If we have succeeded in conveying these three special aspects of life, our story has been 
worthwhile, and our goal has been achieved.
59.23 We are grateful to Shri Shatavadhani R Ganesh, Facebook page “Vaagartha”’s Shri 
Manjunatha Kollegala and Shri K.V. Ramaprasad.
59.35 We are grateful to all the participants and audience.
59.40 We complete this story by praying to Katilu Shri Durga Parameshwari Devi to bless all those 
who enabled the making of this Kathanaka
59.46 the people who enacted this Kathanaka and the audience who listened to this Kathanaka with 
devotion.
59.52 May you all be blessed to have the best in this world and achieve good status in the nether 
world too.
